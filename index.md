# About me <br/>

<font size=3>I am a master candidate of medical informatics at Peking Union Medical College advised by Prof. Jiao Li, where I work on mHealth innovations for chronic disease management, clinical risk prediction, and personalized diet management for older population.  I obtained my bachelor degree at school of nursing, PUMC.  I had one-year clinical experience from 2018 to 2019.</font><br/>

# Research 
<font size=3>I am interested in developing efficient and reliable models for health improvement, which could benefit both healthcare receivers and providers. I work on health issues among vulnerable populations and possible solutions.  </font><br/>

## Recent Projects<br/>
<font size=4>** - Personalized Diet Recommendation for Community-dweling Elders **
<font size=3>We expect to develop an deploy a recommendation system to provide older population with alternatives of packaged meals, which could take their health conditions, diet preference, and socio-economic status into account .</font><br/>

<font size=4>** - Post-stroke UTI Prediction in Immobile Patients **
<font size=3>We integrated 6 machine learning algorithms to generate a UTI prediction model for immobile hospitalized stroke patients. The result of SHAP analysis alined well with clinical evidence and literature review, which adds credits to the interpretability and reliablity of the prediction model.</font><br/>

<font size=4>** - Health behavior improvement with mHealth interventions **
<font size=3>We designed and implemented a transtheoretical-model-based behavior change intervention strategy for high-risk groups of diabetes delivered by a mobile application in a 6-month RCT.</font><br/>
